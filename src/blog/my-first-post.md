This is a playground for blog styles. In theory this should never get deployed. However, I will probably accidentally push this live one day.

### Images

Images should break out of the centre container. This should be the same for a few other elements as well.

### Quotes

> Thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows
>
> â€” Troilus and Cressida, Act 2 Scene 1, Lines 42-43; Thersites to Ajax

Things I need to fix...

- Remove the quotes added by tailwind typography
- Fix the colors of the blockquote

Videos should also be possible.
